// Javascript and python is a Interpreted language where as c and c++ is a compiled language.

// Interpreted language is a language that is executed line by line. Int this language the line by line code is converted to machine level code.

// Compiled language is a language that is compiled into machine code before execution.

console.log("Hello World");
console.log(a);
/*this will throw an error because a is not defined.
but in python and javascript this will not throw an error because they are interpreted language.
but in c and c++ this will throw an error because they are compiled language.
and the above hello world will be printed on the console.*/

/*javascript is a dynamically typed language or loosely typed language.
in which we can assign any type of data to a variable.*/

var a = 10;
a = "Hello";
a = true;

console.log(a);


// where as in c and c++ we have to specify the type of data to a variable.
// and if we try to change the type for variable that have been initalised first then it will throw error.

// int a = 10;
// a = "Hello"; // this will throw an error.

// Javascript is a single threaded language.
// single threaded language is a language that can only execute one task at a time.
// It will have single process to run on the core , it will not split the code to run on multiple threads.
// javascript is a synchronous language.
// synchronous language is a language that executes code line by line.

// javascript is a event driven language.

// event driven language is a language that executes code based on events.
// for example, when a button is clicked, a function is called.

// javascript is a non-blocking language.
// non-blocking language is a language that does not block the execution of code.


// That's why javascript is not considered for scalable applications.

// javascript is a single threaded language.
// single threaded language is a language that can only execute one task at a time.

// javascript is a synchronous language.

// Where as in java c++ , the code can be split in to multiple thread that can use the power of multiple cores , and can be run faster 
// and can be used for scalable applications.
